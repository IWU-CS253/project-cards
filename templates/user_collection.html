{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}


<!----We will need to loop through the cards in the user collection,
the same way we looped through entries to our flaskr website:
this code is going to be inside the loop--->
<div class="box">
    <h1> Card Name</h1>
    <h2>Card Rarity</h2>
    <h3>Short Card Description</h3>
</div>

{% endblock %}
