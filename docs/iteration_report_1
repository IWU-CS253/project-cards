**Responsibilities:**

This iteration, Eric and Terascence were responsible for setting up the database in SQL which will include three tables for storing all of the existing cards, 
all of the cards in a user collection, and all of the cards in the marketplace. Dino was responsible for setting up very early versions of the html files for 
the platform’s main pages, and Karthi was responsible for the request handlers (Changed to some basic html structures during the week due to no buttons that 
have actions besides switching between links) we will use to navigate between these pages. Garrett was responsible for setting up some unit testing for the 
basic functionality of switching between pages and displaying some database information. 

**What was completed: **

	Dino set up html files outlining the content we want to include on each of our main pages- just using text in place of some of the actual functionality which 
  has not been implemented yet. Garrett set up his own development branch that he plans to use throughout the project. He also wrote some unit tests into his 
  development branch that was later merged into the main branch with the additions everyone else made. Eric wrote a few tables intended to be the basis for the 
  database. It will probably change a lot as time goes on. Karthi added links to the website connecting to different urls to make sure that users can access all 
  features of the website.

**What was not finished: **

	As a group, we completed all of the tasks we set out to do at the start of the iteration. 

**Issues we ran into: **

	We had a bit of trouble using git to share work. Eventually, we straightened out our issues, but it was a hitch in our plan since some of the work for this 
  iteration was dependent on other parts of the work being completed. Going forward, we should avoid assigning work during the same iteration as another 
  element that must be completed first. If we absolutely need to do it, the group member working on the dependency will just have to be sure to start very early. 

**Adjustments to overall design:**

	So far, our overall design has stayed pretty much intact. Since we are just putting together a very early skeleton version of the app, 
  we haven’t run into any issues significant enough to necessitate changes to our design. 

**Helpful tools/approaches: **

	It is helpful to meet in person at least once and stay in constant contact through snapchat so we can easily find how our group mates are progressing on 
  their parts. This is especially important when some work is dependent on the product of another member’s work, because it must be merged before that section 
  of work can begin.

**Plan for next iteration: **

**	**Flesh out the tables in the database more by planning what a card will look like and what parts of a card matter not only to the user but to the 
back-end of the application as well. We will also need to update the html now that we can utilize card objects and attributes from the database.
