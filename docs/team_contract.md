**Leader Responsibilities:**

**Group Decisions:**



* Group decisions will be made by majority vote
    * No need for a tiebreaker since we have 5 members

**Team Expectations:**



* Continued communication via Snapchat or Discord (in our group chat)
* Attendance at all meetings unless communicated beforehand and replaced with work to maintain progress
* Work assigned done by next team meeting to ensure continual progress

**Process for Obligations not being met:**



* One time grace for non-attendance or unfinished work with no communication beforehand, with justification afterwards required.
    * We understand that each group member has different commitments outside of classes so as long as unfinished work or non-attendance is communicated, we will make the best out of the situation.
* Beyond that, reach out to professor Liffiton for a correction.

**Meeting Times outside of class if necessary: **



* 11:00 - Monday
* 11:00 - Friday
* 11:00 - Sunday
* Location is planned to be in either CNS or a room in State Farm Hall

**Group Communication:**



* Discord group
* Snapchat group

These are just the basic ideas we thought our contract should cover while including everything that was required from Moodle. Down the road if our group feels anything needs to be changed or added, we plan on doing this and checking with Professor Liffiton before our changes or additions are actually set in place.
