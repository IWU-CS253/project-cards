**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Digital Trading Cards</span>**

**Responsibilities:**

Dino was responsible for implementing user authentication for the app. Garrett was responsible for adding some Bootstrap code to make the layout and functionality of our application more user friendly. Eric was responsible for creating an excel sheet that we could add cards to. Karthi was responsible for creating a view for all cards. Terasence was responsible for adding 50 cards to the excel sheet.

**What was completed:**

Eric created an excel sheet to add cards to. Terasence wrote up the details of those cards, and Eric downloaded them as a csv to import them into the database. This spreadsheet could continue to be our method of creating and adding cards. At some point (maybe by next week) we could develop a way to display the individual cards, have descriptions, and some ideas for card graphics. Dino implemented user authentication by adding functionality for creating new user accounts, ensuring usernames and emails are unique, salting/hashing passwords, checking user credentials and redirecting to the main page if the credentials are correct. He also added some code to the database to create a table of users and prevent the program from failing when run more than once. Garrett was able to add Bootstrap to some of the html pages that we have created so far. He worked on the home.html page, the user_collection.html page, the marketplace.html page, and the friends.html page. This week, he focused on adding Bootstrap to enhance those specific pages. Last week when we just had a simple skeleton of the page, the pages were very messy with the content all over the place. He wanted to go through and add some Bootstrap to make the pages more user friendly as well as better looking. He feels that he accomplished this and that this will continue to be a work in progress as we add some more content to these pages. Garrett was also able to integrate GitHub Actions to automatically run our unit tests as well. Karthi added a way to view all cards in the user collection, an additional thing that would need to be added would be a way to filter all the cards in the future

**What was not finished:**

As a group, we completed all of the tasks we set out to do at the start of the iteration. 

**Issues we ran into:**

Garrett had some issues with Bootstrap not displaying things in the right ways or spots. When this was the case, he would use the Bootstrap page ([getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)) to look for ways to better display things. This page was super helpful in fixing any issues he ran into regarding Bootstrap. While implementing user authentication, Dino ran into some minor problems with the correct way to retrieve information from the forms and database but figured it out. Dino also had some trouble merging his branch to implement the changes he made when he was finished, but that was also straightened out. Garrett also had some trouble with merging his changes from his branch into the main branch.

**Adjustments to overall design:**

So far, our overall design has continued to move in a direction that we have planned on outputting. Since it is still relatively early and we are continuing to add to the early skeleton of our application, we haven’t run into any issues significant enough to necessitate changes to our design. As a result of this, we have continued moving in a direction that is going to result in an application that produces what we have planned since day 1.

**Helpful tools/approaches:**

Once again, we found that meeting in person and continued communication through our group chat is very helpful and necessary to know where our group mates are at with things regarding their tasks. By communicating, we are able to help each other if anyone is stuck or struggling or just talk about things that have come up since the beginning of the week. It is also very helpful in keeping each other on task and continued progression with their assigned task so we are able to merge all of our changes together at the end of each iteration.

**Important thing you learned during this iteration:**

As a group, we learned that things are going to get more complicated very quickly. While these first few weeks were a lot of simple tasks, we are starting to progress to more challenging things. While this can be scary, it is going to be rewarding when at the end of the semester, our group has a digital trading cards application that is functional. But to get to this point, we need to continue to communicate with each other and keep each other accountable. This application isn’t going to just form out of nowhere. A lot of things need to be put together in order for this to happen.

**Plan for next iteration:**

Dino will keep working on user authentication – it is functional right now but needs to be cleaned up so certain errors don’t crash the program. Log - out function also needs to be implemented. 

Karthi will keep working on the view of all cards to make it look more professional/not garbage. It is functional currently.

Terasence will work to add more themes for card packs and cards for the themes to the sheet. Terasence will also continue to work with the overall implementation, with a focus on reasonable distribution and management of inventory of the cards in the trading card app.

Garrett plans to continue working on adding Bootstrap to some of the new pages that have been implemented along with helping out with any other issues or potential new things that need to be added to our application. 

Eric plans to start working on creating a randomizer to pick out cards from the database. Eric also talked about attempting to start setting up the marketplace table and Garrett mentioned that he would help out with that as well.
